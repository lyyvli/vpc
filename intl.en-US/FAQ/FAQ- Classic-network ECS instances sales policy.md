## FAQ {#section_zqm_pl4_tdb .section}

**Why did Alibaba Cloud stop selling classic-network ECS instances in some regions?**

Alibaba Cloud stopped selling classic-network ECS instances in some regions because VPCs are more secure and flexible than classic networks. Specifically, VPCs provide higher performance and better user experience and support hybrid cloud scenarios. VPCs represent the direction of future development of private networks.

**When will the policy take effect in regions other than the preceding regions?**

The policy will be implemented in other regions after March 2017 upon further notice.

**Can new customers purchase classic-network and VPC cloud resources other than VPC ECS instances, VPC SLB instances, and VPC RDS instances?**

A: Yes, they can. However, we recommend that new customers choose the VPC network type when they purchase other cloud resources because VPC will be the default network type for other cloud products later.

**If I can only purchase VPC cloud resources, can they communicate with other cloud resources normally?**

Yes, they can. Most cloud resources provided by Alibaba Cloud support VPCs. Alibaba Cloud will ensure that the cloud resources in the regions where the policy is effective are connected to VPCs.

**Can I check which network type of cloud products I can purchase in a specific region?**

No, you cannot check which network type of cloud products you can purchase in a specific region.

**Is it possible that I purchase a cloud resource of an incorrect network type?**

Yes, it is possible for new customers to purchase cloud resources of the classic network type by mistake. To avoid this, we recommend that you make sure you select the correct network type when you purchase any cloud resources.

**What should I do if I have purchased a cloud resource of an incorrect network type?**

You can switch the network in the corresponding cloud product console. If the network switching function is unavailable, submit a ticket to Alibaba Cloud for technical support \(excluding ECS\).
