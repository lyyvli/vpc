# Attach a VPC to a CEN instance {#concept_1425964 .concept}

This topic describes how to attach a VPC to a CEN instance. By using a CEN instance, you can establish a private channel between two VPCs or between a VPC and an on-premises data center to interconnect global cloud resources. You can attach a VPC to a CEN instance under the same account, or attach a VPC to a CEN instance under another account through cross-account authorization.

## Attach a VPC to a CEN instance under the same account {#section_w31_f7j_n2a .section}

You can attach a VPC to a CEN instance under the same account. By doing so, the VPC can communicate with other VPCs in the CEN instance or on-premises data centers. For more information, see [Attach a VPC or VBR to a CEN instance through the instance details page](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage networks/Attach a VPC or VBR to a CEN instance through the instance details page.md#).

## Grant cross-account permissions to a CEN {#section_i0e_gdm_t2b .section}

You can attach a VPC to a CEN instance under another account after you grant permissions to the CEN. In this way, the VPC can communicate with the instances in the CEN. For more information, see [Cross-account authorization](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage networks/Cross-account authorization.md#).
