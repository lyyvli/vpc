# Create cloud resources in a VSwitch {#task_1375138 .task}

This topic describes how to create cloud resources in a VSwitch. You can deploy cloud resources in a VPC only after you create these resources in a VSwitch \(subnet\) of the VPC.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **VSwitches**.
3.  Select the region of the VPC to which the target VSwitch belongs.
4.  On the VSwitches page, find the target VSwitch, click **Purchase** in the **Actions** column, and then select the cloud resource that you want to create. You can create ECS instances, SLB instances, and RDS instances in a VSwitch.
5.  On the cloud resource creation page, create a cloud resource.
