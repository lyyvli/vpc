# Create a custom route table {#task_1012575 .task}

This topic describes how to create a custom route table. After you create a custom route table for a VPC, you can manage the flow of subnet traffic to or from the VPC.

You can create custom route tables in all regions except China \(Beijing\), China \(Shenzhen\), and China \(Hangzhou\).

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/vpc).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Route Tables**.
3.  Select the region of the route table to be created.
4.  On the Route Tables page, click **Create Route Table**.
5.  On the Create Route Table page, set the parameters, and then click **OK**. The following table describes the parameters. 

    |Configuration|Description|
    |-------------|-----------|
    |**Resource Group**|Select the resource group to which the route table belongs.|
    |**VPC**|Select the VPC to which the route table belongs.|
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the route table. The name must be 2 to 128 characters in length and can contain letters, numbers, underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\). It must start with a letter.
