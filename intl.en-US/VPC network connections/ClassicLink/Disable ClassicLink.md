# Disable ClassicLink {#task_oys_qhd_sdb .task}

This topic describes how to disable the ClassicLink function of a VPC. After you disable the ClassicLink function of a VPC, classic-network ECS instances cannot establish a ClassicLink connection with the VPC.

The ClassicLink connection between the classic-network ECS instance and the VPC is disconnected. For more information, see [Disconnect a ClassicLink connection](reseller.en-US/VPC network connections/ClassicLink/Disconnect a ClassicLink connection.md#).

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/vpc).
2.  Select the region to which the target VPC belongs.
3.  On the VPCs page, find the target VPC, and then click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
4.  On the VPC Details page, click **Disable ClassicLink**.
5.  In the Disable ClassicLink dialog box, click **OK**.
